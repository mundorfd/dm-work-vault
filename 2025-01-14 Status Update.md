## Rating Scale: 😀😐😕😲

## Course Development Projects

### S25

#### BB 345 😕

David Hendrix did not attend our last meeting and hasn't met with me for several weeks.

I emailed this concern to you:

I wonder if we should contact the department about this course/instructor. While I see that he has begun putting some content in his [Canvas sandbox](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/2006302/modules "https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/2006302/modules"), I have struggled to get David to respond to email requests for updates or schedule check-in meetings (see below). I can't confidently determine if he will be ready for Spring without hearing from him about what is ready for review and what is remaining.

#### CS 162 😀

- Delivered content
	- All module content
	- Course Syllabus
- Pending
	- Two remaining videos to record
	- May make some updates to module 7 and add additional requirements to assignments, but this is less likely
- Canvas Build
	- Modules 1–4

#### CS 461 😐

We are off to a reasonable start, but this is ambitious for a one-term build.

- Media requests approved and submitted
	- Bill wants to include professional insights from software engineering professionals to help students understand key topics like standing out as job candidates, succeeding in their first roles, and real-world software development processes.
	  I have several contacts in SW engineering from my previous work. Earlier this week I contacted a friend with extensive experience in UX, front-end development, and agile practices. He is happy to participate in a short interview for the course. Yesterday I connected him with Bill via email, providing background context and aligning expectations for the interview.
- Shared WIC requirements with Bill - discussed with you his plan to use a wiki-style SW documentation, as used in the field for the longer word-count activities.
- Bill has completed module week 1

#### CS 474 😀

- Delivered content - 5 modules
- Pending - second half, although Guillermo plans to reuse much of the existing content for the second half of the course
- Canvas Build - Overview pages through module 5

#### CS 561 😀

- Delivered content - Through module 6, minus recordings.
- Pending - recordings, module 7–10
- Canvas Build - Through Module 4

#### EMGT 562 😀

- Delivered content
	- Recorded all 13 videos. Sent back edits on 12 of them.
	- Content delivered for modules
- Pending
- Canvas Build

### U24

#### BEE 529 😀

We have completed intake and I have sent some guidance to John on developing a media plan. He has logged into the DOC, but not yet started participating.

#### CE 392 😀

Just had intake this week, he's been tricky to schedule with. Corinne Benz asked to sit in on the intake. Seems enthusiastic though and ready to work in DOC.

I have sent some guidance to Sal on developing a media plan. He sent some good ideas about active learning, refresher concepts, and learning materials after brainstorming with Corinne Benz.

#### CS 435 😀

- Delivered content
	- Modules 1–4 of 6 planned (some span multiple week)
- Canvas Build
	- been working on media request and setting up her sandbox. She has customization requests.

#### SOC 480 😀

- completed intake

#### VETS-UP

- not started. I need to reach out to Albrecht Jander about when he would like to meet

## Non-Course Projects

### AI Council

- Now includes 42 Examples
- Updated the landing page with instructions, overview and category definitions in the [AI Assessment Examples database](https://aicouncil.oregonstate.education/)
- Updated the Human Centric samples. Each human-centric assignment example was revised to include a clear focus on the uniquely human elements of learning and skill development.
- Updated the examples from [Ecampus Artificial Intelligence and Academic Integrity Resources](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963496) Canvas site to match the format and categorization of the AI Assessment Database.
- Researched how to filter AI Assessment Examples by multiple categories (e.g., Human-Centric, Stem, Formative, Evaluate) rather than just drilling down from the main page, which would be to purchase a plugin. This would cost $30 first year, including support $15 for Subsequent years

### Internship Program

- Connected all three Interns with mentors
- Scheduled recurring meetings with me
- Completed Internship Learning Contracts and returned to students to submit to their program

#### Terrance Working w/Meghan

- Focus on hands-on Canvas building, starter HTML skills (ACTG 425, PSY 478), intake observation (BA 213z), and potential exposure to project management in Asana; starting ACTG 425 tomorrow.

#### Carmin Working with Julie

- Has begun supporting the build for 1 of 2 courses. Julie has her up and running and says it is going great. She comes in with experience to contribute immediately.

#### Amy with Cyndie

Amy is working with Cyndie on the internship courses beyond OSU courses. She will also support building components as the DOC is going for Cyndie's DOC participants

### IDKB

- [Student Media Assignments – IDKB 🦫](https://idkb.oregonstate.education/knowledge-base/student-media-assignments/)
- updates to [ID Media Guide – IDKB 🦫](https://idkb.oregonstate.education/knowledge-base/id-media-guide/)

### ROC Refresh

- Initial meeting

### UQATE Taskforce

- Starting mini pilot with EMGT 562 media project
