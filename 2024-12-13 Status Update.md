## S25

### BB 345 😕

- Delivered content
	- Very little. Just a few module-level outcomes.
- Concerns
	- He is largely unavailable (unwilling?) to meet with me. I have sent a second request today (to follow up on the one from last week)
	- He has repeatedly said that he is "focusing on just getting things formatted correctly". I have said this in October, which wasn't the first time, and reiterated it today:

		> I can clean up the HTML for you, I do it all the time. Given that we are falling a bit behind, your time would be much better spent on developing any new content.

	- He has lost one term of development.

## Internship Program

- Received application materials for Winter 25. Three candidates, one of which is from Carmin would like to return
- I scheduled interviews for two of them. Carmin, I won't have interview since she has done good work fall term and is on FMLA briefly, and it will save the interviewers time.
