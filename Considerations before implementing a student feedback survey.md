# Questions to Ask Before Creating and Implementing a Student Feedback Survey

- **Why do you want to include a student feedback survey?**  
  Clarify your purpose: Is it for improving instruction, checking comprehension, supporting engagement, or informing future course design?

- **Will the survey be graded?**  
  Decide if you want to offer credit (e.g., completion points or participation). Grading can boost response rates but may influence the candor of feedback.

- **What will you do with the feedback?**  
  Identify how you’ll use the results. Will it prompt course adjustments? Will you acknowledge and respond to student suggestions? Consider your capacity: Will you read all responses? Are you hoping to make instructional changes or just monitor student perceptions?

- **How much feedback can you realistically review and act on?**  
  Your class size and available time matter. For large classes or tight schedules, keep the survey short, focused, and easy to scan, like 1–2 key open-ended questions or scaled items.

- **What type of data are you looking for?**  
  Choose formats based on your goals: quantitative (e.g., scales or ratings) or qualitative (e.g., open comments).

- **How often will you survey students?**  
  Think about timing—early-term, midterm, end-of-term, or weekly check-ins. Too frequent can cause fatigue, and too rare may miss key insights.

- **Do you want the responses to be anonymous?**  
  Anonymity may encourage honesty, but named responses allow follow-up or individualized support.

- **Who will see the results?**  
  Define your audience: Is it just you? Will it be shared with students? Will it be shared with your TAs or a teaching team? Will it be part of a program review?

- **How will you communicate the results back to students?**  
  Let students know how their input was used. Even a brief message builds trust and transparency.

- **What platform will you use?**  
  Choose a tool (Canvas survey, Qualtrics, Google Form) that fits your needs for accessibility, ease of use, and analytics.

- **How will you manage and analyze the data?**  
  Consider how you’ll summarize responses—especially open-ended ones—and how you’ll store or track feedback over time.

- **Have you considered accessibility and inclusivity?**  
  Ensure clear language, screen-reader compatibility, and inclusive prompts.

- **What will you do if a student shares something concerning or personal in their response?**  
  Be prepared for disclosures related to mental health, financial hardship, or unsafe situations. Know your responsibilities and reporting requirements, and have referral resources ready (e.g., academic advising, counseling services, basic needs support, [Ecampus Student Success](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/services/student-services/)).
