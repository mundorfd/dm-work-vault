## Instructor Presence

The following strategies offer practical ways to build instructor presence in an online course through asynchronous, low-effort activities. These options help you stay visible and engaged with students throughout the term without relying on recorded slide-based lectures.

---

### Weekly Engagement Options

- **Asynchronous "Office Hours" via Q&A Threads**
  Post a recurring discussion thread like "Ask Me Anything (Week X)" or "Office Hours – Drop Your Questions Here."
  Check in regularly and respond to student questions. Optionally compile highlights in a weekly wrap-up.
  Use short video or audio replies to personalize the experience.

- **Recorded Problem-Solving with Student Input**
  Collect student-submitted questions or problem areas via a form or discussion.
  Pick 1–2 each week, record a walkthrough, and post it with a friendly note:
  _"This week’s challenge: Let’s break down Sara’s question about boundary conditions…"_

- **Asynchronous AMA (Ask Me Anything)**
  Students can ask course—or field-related questions using a discussion board, Padlet, Microsoft Whiteboard, or Miro.
  Respond using text, audio, or video over several days. Group responses when helpful.

### Embedded Presence Throughout the Course

- **Instructor Announcements with Personality**
  Share weekly updates with course context, encouragement, or informal touches like memes or research photos.

- **"Sticky Notes from the Instructor"**
  Add brief text or audio comments on key pages—e.g., “Common misconception here…” or “Why this concept matters.”

- **Auto-graded Practice with Feedback in Your Voice**
  Use quiz feedback boxes for tips, humor, or clarifications: “Remember to watch your units!”

- **Discussion Wrap-Up Posts or Highlight Reels**
  Summarize key takeaways and spotlight great student insights at the end of each discussion.

- **Instructor-Curated ‘What’s in the News’ Tie-ins**
  Share timely articles or events related to STEM topics to promote relevance and real-world connections.

### Creative / Community-Oriented Approaches

- **Weekly “What I’m Reading/Watching” Posts**
  Share what you're reading—course-related, science-in-the-news, or even personal picks—to humanize your role.

- **"Meet the Instructor’s Lab" Photo Tour**
  Give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of your research space or tools with captions or narration.

- **Instructor Reaction Threads**
  Publicly respond to a few standout discussion or assignment posts each week to show you're listening and engaged.

- **Collaborative Annotation Tools**
  Use tools like [Perusall](https://www.perusall.com/) to co-annotate readings, graphs, or datasets asynchronously.

- **Microsoft Teams Chat Channel**
  If your course uses Teams, create a dedicated "Instructor Corner" channel where you can post weekly tips, answer common questions, or share informal updates.
