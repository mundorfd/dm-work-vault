# Salesforce Course Design Record Guide for Instructional Designers

## General Overview of Course Design Records

Course Design Records are generated during the **MOU process** and contain critical information about course development. Some fields are system-generated, while others require input from the ID, AD or Course Development Team (CDT).

## 1. Details Section

### Fields and Responsibilities

- **Course Number**: Automatically generated by Banner. IDs cannot edit this field.
- **Proposal**: Reflects the course proposal, which may not always match the course title. Instructional Designers should ensure the correct course title is entered in the **Development Notes**.
- **Delivery Term**: Set during the MOU process and updated by the AD, this term refers to the timeline for course completion, not the first offering to students.
- **Development Term**: IDs must confirm with faculty if they will work during the summer. Always clarify with the instructor if summer development is expected.
- **First Term of Offer**: This field should be added by the ID, confirming the first term the course will be offered. _***Note that this field does not affect the delivery term.**_
- **Status**:
  - **Pending Assignment**: Set by AD.
  - **Assigned**: Updated when welcome letters are sent.
  - **Under Development**: IDs change this status after intake.
  - **Completed**: Set when the build percentage reaches 100%.
  - **Hold**: Set by AD if a delay is approved.
  - **Withdrawn**: Set by AD if the project is canceled.
- **Honors College**: Verify if the course is part of the Honors College and update accordingly.

## 2. Staff Assignments

- **Instructional Designer**: Filled in by AD.
- **Media Developer**: This field is being phased out.
- **Not Available for Summer**: Confirm availability with the instructor and update this field if needed.

## 3. Training

- **Training Fields**: These fields reflect training completion, not requirements. Katherine manually updates them. Training requirements should be noted in the welcome email. If nothing is checked, likely needs training.

IDs should **talk to AD** if any training requirements need adjustments or updates.

## 4. Information Section

Instructional Designers are responsible for maintaining the following fields in the **Information Section**:

- **Credit Hours**: Auto-populated but must be verified by the ID.
- **Modality**: Ensure the course modality (online, hybrid, etc.) is correctly entered.
- **Type of Development**: ID to confirm. Select between new course development or redevelopment (refresh). Minor redevelopments may focus on specific media updates.
- **Narrated Lectures**: Mark as appropriate (this field is being phased out).
- **Proctoring Required**: Mark as appropriate (this field is being phased out).
- **OER**: Open Educational Resources (OER) are tracked automatically but should be confirmed if applicable.
- **Site Listing**: Ensure the correct course ID and build site information are listed. Enter the sandbox site name (not the URL) until the course is transferred to the Banner site.

IDs must also update any accessibility concerns in the **Development Notes** section.

## 5. Tracking and Percentages

- **Build Percentage**: IDs are responsible for updating the build percentage throughout the development. Once the build reaches **95%**, the course can be evaluated for payout. If a course is **not fully built**, do not mark it as 100%â€”provide an explanation in the notes.
- **Fund Transfer and Proposal Amount**: IDs should not discuss financial matters with the faculty. Any questions should be directed to AD.

## 6. Feedback & Ecampus Essentials

Instructional Designers must complete the **Ecampus Essentials Review** within a month of completing the course development. They are encouraged to update during development with relevant information intermittently. The description for each Essential can be found in [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tNey4oMYFYzREqNnO1tHi93mYiU2U5AAgknbXSK-NM0/edit?gid=0#gid=0) _Note detailed information on evaluating each Essential is being captured elsewhere, stay tuned_

## Communication and Project Management

- **Development Notes**: These should be regularly updated with any changes in project status, delivery terms, or developer availability.

Communication should be documented via email and in the Course Design Notes for any changes in delivery schedules, developer assignments, or MOU agreements**.
