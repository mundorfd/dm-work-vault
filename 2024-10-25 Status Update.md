## Course Development Projects

### W25

#### MUS 349

Alina has content delivered through Module 6. I have built roughly half of that. Straight forward build, no concerns

#### CE 535

60% of written content delivered

From Michael:

> I am working on CE 535 videos to have as many as possible in by the media deadlines.

#### CS 432

- Discussion with Ami and Danielle about course
- Amy was done developing content through Module 8
- Rebuilt some of Ami's graphic for color contrast
- Designed all Overview pages and reviewed with Ami

### S25

#### BB 345

- David is off to a pretty slow start. He's asking a ton of questions about design options, but delivered very little content. He's very hung up on formatting content, despite repeated assurances that this is an area I will take care of for him. His course content is mostly coming from Google Slides, he says.

#### CS 162

- Tim has a "first draft" of all the content. His remaining activities include:
	- recording new videos, he feels like this is 1/3 of total work
	- second pass through all the modules
	- assignment design decisions (may include mandatory unit tests)
	- take a pass through exercises
	- syllabus
- I have redone all the overview pages, banners, home page. Redesigned exploration pages in modules 1 & 2.
- Shared some thoughts from the SS presentation about DFW rate in these classes. Suggested some scaffolding. Tim needed to process …

#### CS 474

- Week before last finally able to do intake with Guillermo.
- Worked through questions on the DOC week 3 assignment and answered questions on accessibility.
- Confirmed media request, he plans a lot of lectures (70!) and weekly overview videos.
- He does plan to reuse some existing material, but it was all on a website, not Canvas

#### CS 561

- Chris has submitted through module 3 and begun work on module 4. I have built some of this content.
- Ongoing course design activities.

#### EMGT 562

- Outlined and sketched requirements for custom web app, submitted [Custom Media Request for Connect Three Game](https://app.asana.com/0/1208129321824098/1208573157201912)
- Confirmed and submitted lecture and video media requests
- Ami has not yet delivered module content… but has an increasingly detailed course outline, that now includes MLOs and planned materials and activities. (Not quite sure how to capture this in percentages)

### Out of Cycle

- MAST 300: Lori finally got all media done and embedded, marked 100%

## Non-Course Projects

### AI Council 2.0

- Redesign [AI Assessment Examples Database](https://aicouncil.oregonstate.education/) with Ecampus logo and OSU colors.
- Seven assignments examples present. More to come this week, the IDs who are helping have returned 1 or 2 each and I have a few more I can develop from the STEM/LA assignment descriptions shared in the old Canvas site (these for the most part weren't flushed out assignments)

### UQATE Taskforce

- I added an impact section that includes the updates to processes and responsibilities for the Web Team, IDs, and Instructors.
- Tiered Approach
	- We proposed a mechanism to evaluate projects for levels of testing. This is in the Scope section, but most details are captured in a new appendix.
- Student Experience Survey
	- I recently developed and deployed a student experience survey for a custom web tool. I included this example in an appendix as well.
- Sent updated report to Karen

### IDKB

- Sent IDs the list of new and updated articles for September and October
- wrote [Peerceptiv](https://idkb.oregonstate.education/knowledge-base/peerceptiv/)

### Internship Program

- Talked through some LaTex issues with Carmin on her project.
- Provided lesson 2 in HTML
- Discussion with Lindsay Andrews about Internships. Planned application deadlines, discussed a particular student that wants to apply but hasn't finished the course technology series yet. (We have been asking applicants to wait until this is done, without some exposure to developing content in Canvas, we have had some internships that weren't that productive for Ecampus and extremely time consuming for the IDs involved.) In this case it was a working ID with several years of LMS experience, so plan on making a (quiet) exception.

### Sr. ID Responsibilities

- Met with other SR IDs. Discussed and updated the task list: [Senior ID Tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tb6d-czF304tFQdyRzdgnwBSu67mRgkGhAfEJooGT60/edit?tab=t.0)
