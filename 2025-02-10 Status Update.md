# 2025-02-10 Status Report

## Rating Scale: 😀😐😕😲

## Course Development Projects

### S25

#### BB 345 😕

- Delivered content: David has mostly finished three modules, working on #4, and has started (DIY) recordings.
- Canvas Build: I have caught up with David, waiting for more content

#### CS 162 😀

- Delivered content: Tim is done, waiting to transfer to a live site. Considering re-recording one video
- Canvas Build: Everything delivered has been built. Have begun wrap up activities

#### CS 461 😐

- Delivered content: Has been making good progress. Not working linearly, but has completed ~40% of planned content. Unlikely to make the 100% content deadline given the compressed timeline but I expect him to be done in time to build the course for start of term.
- Canvas Build: Only at 10%

#### CS 474

- Delivered content: Written content has delivered 9 modules and finished recording videos. He had a TA design four labs which he now needs to review.
