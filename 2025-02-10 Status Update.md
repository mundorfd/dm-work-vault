## 2025-02-10 Status Report

### Rating Scale: 😀😐😕😲

### Course Development Projects

#### S25

##### BB 345 😕

- Delivered content: David has mostly finished three modules, working on #4, and has started (DIY) recordings.
- Canvas Build: I have caught up with David, waiting for more content

##### CS 162 😀

- Delivered content: Tim is done, waiting to transfer to a live site. Considering re-recording one video
- Canvas Build: Everything delivered has been built. Have begun wrap up activities

##### CS 461 😐

- Delivered content: Has been making good progress. Not working linearly, but has completed ~40% of planned content. Unlikely to make the 100% content deadline given the compressed timeline but I expect him to be done in time to build the course for start of term.
- Canvas Build: Only at 10%

##### CS 474 😀

- Delivered content: Written content has delivered nine modules and finished recording videos. He had a TA design four labs, which he now needs to review.
- Canvas Build: A bit slow, like my other CS courses, this one is very dense. For each one, we are building the learning materials/text book on Exploration Pages. Here's a sample lab, for example:

<video src="https://media.oregonstate.edu/id/1_rx54ypf1?width=400&height=285&playerId=44855082" controls></video>

I have built two modules and two labs. I have sourced several images that he is using in lectures.
