# Status

‚úì: On track

‚ö†Ô∏è: Some concern

üö®: At risk

## Course Development Projects

### W25

#### MUS 349 ‚úì

**Instructor Deliverables**

- Alina has delivered content through module 6
- cancelled our last checkin

**Content build**

- I have built modules 1‚Äì4 and finished the learning materials pages in the next two modules

#### CE 535 ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Instructor Deliverables**

- All written content for modules 1‚Äì10 has been delivered.
- Lecture content is developed but supporting lecture videos have not been started. Michael is at risk of being transitioned to DIY again.

**Content build**

Studio site: [CE_535](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/2006318)

- It's a bit slow‚Ä¶ very lengthy modules, see below. I have only completed the first module build, but I have templated the pages in several others, I expect the build to go a little bit quicker now.
- We are embedding interactive coding activities with a new opensource tool starting in week 3. This may take a bit to build as well.

#### CS 432 ‚úì

Ami has a first draft of all her module content in [CS_432](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1983913). I am working on review and clean up of the site.

#### EMGT 595 ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Instructor Deliverables**

- Instructors have delivered weeks 1 & 2

### S25

#### BB 345 ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Instructor Communication and MLO Feedback**
- Provided detailed feedback on Module Learning Outcomes (MLOs) for clarity, measurability, and alignment with Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs).
- Example guidance was given for Week 2 outcomes, with suggestions for using specific, measurable verbs and linking MLOs directly to relevant CLOs.
- Highlighted the importance of higher-order cognitive skills and Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy for outcome development.

**Current Module Development Progress**
- Modules 1‚Äì6 have initial outcomes listed, though additional module overviews are still required.
- Offering ongoing HTML cleanup and structural support to enable the instructor to focus on content creation. He seems resistant to this. Perhaps because he doesn't really have much content yet.

**Content Delivery Checkpoints Established**
- Milestones communicated to track progress against content delivery deadlines:
   - First Module due November 19, 2024
   - Incremental content checkpoints set for December, January, and February
- Development is still at 0% completion, pending confirmation of fully completed sections.

#### CS 162 ‚úì

**Instructor Content**

- Roughly 50% of the material is going to be updated from the previous Ecampus development
- Exploration pages are done
- Tim has finished 20% of his recordings, and hopes to complete most before winter break

**Content Build**

- I have finished modules 1 & 2
- I have rebuilt all overview pages with new banners, cleaning up as needed. I need to go through remaining exploration pages, quizzes and question banks, and exercise pages to add syntax highlighting for code.

#### CS 474 ‚úì

- Guillermo has completed the first five weeks of the DOC, just waiting for the final project. We are meeting regularly, so far so good.
- I converted the lab setup documents and fixed several accessibility issues in lab files. Built Lab 1.

#### CS 561 ‚úì

**Instructor Content**

- Chris is making great progress. He has completed modules 1‚Äì4 and is halfway through five.

**Content Build**

- I have built through week 3.
- Redesigned home page and buttons
- Working on differentiated Perusall assignments

#### EMGT 562 ‚úì

**Instructor Content**

- Sue is still working on big picture stuff, but I see steady progress. She has given me one module and has solid plans for the remaining. She is working well with the media team, scheduling interviews and scoping the custom media

**Content Build**

- I have built her site and begun making specific changes to the template she has requested (each unit is color-coded)

### Internship Program

- **H5P Development for CHE 311:** Carmin developed multiple assessment styles in H5P, focusing on properly integrating large equations using LaTeX. Gained confidence in LaTeX and troubleshooting, leveraging ChatGPT to convert math tags from Word to H5P effectively.
- **CHE 311 Project Meetings:** Met with Dana and the CHE 311 instructor. Clarified action items with follow-up emails to address the instructor's concerns regarding meeting expectations. Dana created a to-do document to streamline tasks.
- **Lab Simulation Discussion:** Met with Dana and Hector to explore video simulations for lab components.
- **Accessibility work:** Extracted images from course content, generated alt text using ChatGPT, and sent to the instructor for review (with Dana CC'd), as the instructor is currently delayed on these tasks.
- **Quality Control:** Discussed quality control and in-course surveys with Deborah. Ongoing HTML instruction.

### Sr. ID Responsibilities
